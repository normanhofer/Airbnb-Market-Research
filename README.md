# Airbnb-Market-Research

Airbnb is a digital accomodation marketplace founded in 2008. It links hosts and travellers across more than 1,000 markets around the world (Airbnb Incorporated, "About us", https://press.airbnb.com/about-us/, 31.03.2019). This analysis relies on public Airbnb data and uses the methods of advanced analytics to answer the following business questions:

##### 1. What is the market situation like in both cities? Are there differences?
##### 2. Which are the most expensive neighbourhoods? And in which neighbourhoods most accomodations are offered?
##### 3. What are the main price drivers for Airbnb listings in these two cities?


Methodical Approach of the Analysis:
Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM):

###### I.   Business Understanding
###### II.  Data Understanding
###### III. Data Preparation
###### IV.  Modeling
###### V.   Evaluation
